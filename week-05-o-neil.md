<h1>Weapons of Math Destruction in Study</h1>

<p>In the junior high school period in China, some of the textbooks for Chinese classes were ancient poems and articles. Students needed to be able to recite these ancient poems, and also to know what those words and phrases mean in modern times. Some teachers will study these separately with other content, and some teachers choose to complete this part in a period of time. However, most teachers choose to study this part together, because according to their teaching experience and students' performance data, continuous learning of ancient Chinese can make it easier for students to understand and remember.</p>

<p>To catch up, teachers will teach an ancient article each day and give a two- to four-page quiz the next day. In fact, this is difficult for most students to complete. One is that there is not enough time to absorb knowledge, and not everyone has a very good memory; the other is that learning is always unfamiliar at the beginning, and it takes a buffer time to enter the state. However, students lack buffer time. Teachers need students to transcribe the places that are missed in the quiz to enhance their memory. At the same time, new knowledge is coming and needs to be quizzed. Time is compressed again, which is undoubtedly a vicious circle.
</p>

<p>In this environment, cheating began to occur, and after some students' grades improved, teachers thought they had seen results. Even if some students suggest slowing down, the gradual increase in grades and more high-scoring data gives teachers a firm grip on their ideas. In this way, more students join the ranks of cheating. I once mentioned to a teacher who taught Chinese before about the way of teaching the ancient Chinese part, and she told me that continuous study like this is indeed more productive. Maybe she is right in the general direction, but under the influence of more factors, the authenticity of the data is gradually weakened. Teachers have accelerated their learning under the influence of data, but that data is undoubtedly a weapon of math destruction for students.
