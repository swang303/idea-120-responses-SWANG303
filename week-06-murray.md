  <h1>Virtual World</h1>
  <p>I believe Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful. In fact, in many animes and movies, there have been settings about virtual helmets and virtual cabins. Through these devices, people can have immersive experiences in the virtual world. The effect, the emergence of VR is a transition. Murray predicts that with the development of technology, the viewers will gradually integrate into the three-dimensional virtual world from two-dimensional mobile phones and TVs in the future. The digital virtual world is more real, and the viewers can join and participate in it from different angles. With the participation of the viewers, the virtual world will be more complete, with "wisdom," and can also meet the needs of different types of viewers. In "The Mandalorian," the crew replaced the green screen with an LED screen so that realistic lighting effects were directly obtained during shooting, saving time and money in the post-production process. The most important thing is to give the actors an immersive feeling, and they no longer need to imagine themselves in the scene. In Murray's prediction, the "reality" experienced by the audience is more at the mental level, and the "reality" experienced by the actors in "The Mandalorian" is at the sensory level.</p>
