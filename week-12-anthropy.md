  <h1>Discuss how accessibility to games and coding can help improve video games</h1>
  <p>The accessibility of gaming and coding enables more people to participate in and use video games. In video games, music and visual effects make the game more immersive. It can be said that video games have brought more storytelling and sensory experiences to players. However, relying too much on the senses makes it impossible for a small number of people with disabilities to participate. However, in the same way, with the increase in gameplay, the game operation is more complicated, and some old scripts of stories have also blocked many people's interest in the game.</p>
  <p>The accessibility of games helps people with certain types of disabilities to operate video games. For example, people with sensory impairments cannot hear or visually distinguish dialogues and sounds in games; people with motor impairments cannot use or have some difficulties operating the controller; people with cognitive impairments cannot understand and execute some complex tasks. Some games modify some game settings for the corresponding groups to facilitate them to operate the game and improve accessibility to help these minority groups to participate in the game. Using a gamepad was a big challenge for me because I didn't play games much when I was a kid, so it was hard to get involved when I used a gamepad later. If there is an easier way to operate, I think I can have a better gaming experience.</p>
  <p>The accessibility of coding enables non-professionals to participate in the game's production. The early games were dominated by white males and male engineers, which also made the content of the game and the positioning of the characters subjective and fixed. For example, female characters are not emphasized in the game, or some special groups are ignored. Coupled with the operation of the developers, the majority of the game audience is young men. Digital games are divided into entertainment for fixed groups, and others are kept out. Moreover, the accessibility of coding breaks this layer of avoidance, more non-professionals can use and create games. It's like a YouTube platform where people can upload their favorite videos. Regardless of the audience for these videos and games, it's its own entertainment. Players can find games that suit them, and they are no longer the same. And the producers of the game can also participate in the game from the creator's perspective.</p>
  <p>Perhaps many people experience the creative process of games more, and games are also an art. For example, I heard that some players or game developers had brought real art into the game. The article mentioned that, compared to the script of the movie, the inner monologue of the novel, the game is more suitable for exploring the system and dynamics. Just like many novels have been remade into movies, people can also turn novels or their own stories into games. Unlike reading a novel, the reader watches the story from a bystander's perspective; in the game, the player can participate in the story from a first-person perspective. Combined with the effects of music and screen, playing video games is also a great way to understand and convey a story. Overall, improving the accessibility of games and coding has transformed video games from being a single niche entertainment game into a broad, communicative art.</p>
