  <h1>Nakamura Article Discussion</h1>
  <p>With the advent of new media and the rapid popularization of the Internet, more and more people participate in and use the Internet. Movies, TV series, radio, etc. are gradually integrated. People want to wipe out intolerance against people of color and women in the online world. Nakamura believes that with the involvement of people of color and women, they are also growing rapidly on the Internet. Their relationship with the Internet is interaction. In the article, Nakamura cites "If You Had My Love," a video that reflects a website's vivid visual culture from the camera's point of view. Based on the videos of female stars, it impacts the viewers through the integration of technology. The video reflects that digital media is replaced between the consumer and the maker on the gender position.</p></br>
  <p>TikTok is a popular video production and distribution site today, used by many people, including a large number of women and people of color. I think the software designers wanted more tolerance and freedom. People can publish the views and images they want to express through digital media and gain approval from other users. TikTok is also a social media site where everyone can communicate and cooperate. There are also many types of videos, and its development team hopes to stimulate creativity.
