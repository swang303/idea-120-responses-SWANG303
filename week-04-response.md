<p>If put this image in click-bait news articles.</p>

<p><b>Linguistic Message:</b> "A snowstorm swept through Chicago, and residents were afraid to go out." Literally, people were afraid to go out because the snowstorm swept through Chicago. Maybe it's just residents going out less, but the headline exaggerates the intensity of the blizzard.</p>

<p><b>Iconic Non-coded Messages:</b> The image shows the UIC campus in normal snow.</p>

<p><b>Coded Iconic Messages:</b> Because it's still snowing in the image, which obscures the factual information, people don't know how long this snow will fall, when it will stop, maybe it's just the beginning of a snowstorm. Coupled with the drive of the title, people are curious about the event, and they will click on the article to see how big the snowstorm is.</p>
