  <h1>Project 3 Proposal</h1>
  <p>The story begins with my perspective of waking up on a ship. I lost all memory of my name, where I am, where I am going. Luckily I had a talking cat by my side. I followed the cat to explore the ship, trying to find the cause of my amnesia and to find my other companions. While exploring the ship with the cat, I became familiar with my surroundings and recalled a few things. In flashbacks, I saw another "me" from the cat's point of view. At the end of the story, I regained my memory and got the truth of the matter. The story will be in the form of interludes, telling the "me"'s lonely demise in the universe. "When no one remembers anymore, a person really disappears from this world" luckily, I still remember.
