# Gesamtkunstwerk   
<p>For digital, we can create Gesamtkunstwerk using Premiere Pro and some videos (or photographic photos). Videos and photos are the materials of artworks, and we can choose the themes of these materials, such as family, architecture, nature, etc. Finally, these different fields are integrated through Premiere Pro, such as the interspersed alternation of human's home and nature's home, and try to add music or electronic commentary.</p>   
  
<p>For physical, about the relationship between human development and nature. Experiment with different materials and constructions in a room, create different period walls and add the corresponding furniture. From ancient times to the present, materials have changed from hay and wood to cement and steel bars. Plant different plants on the four walls to show their relationship with nature. From the most primitive trees and grasses to edible fruits to flowers that cater to modern aesthetics. The four walls show the development of the times and the cycle of nature.</p>  
  
<p>In Rhizome Anthology, the _386 DX_, created by Russian artist Alexei Shulgin, meets Gesamtkunstwerk. This is a cyberpunk band starring the Windows 3.1 operating system. In the video "386 DX live in New York City, January 31, 2019", Alexei Shulgin can be seen standing in the middle of the stage, but the real music is a running Windows 3.1 system. It's a performance composition by Shulgin in front of the stage, with an unusual player, and a band with a bizarre electronic screen background.</p>
