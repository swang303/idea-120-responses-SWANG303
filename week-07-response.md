  <h1>Bridle Article Discussion</h1>
  <p>In this article, Bridle focuses on the various violent horrors and profit-oriented video content on the Internet and thinks about giving children free access to the Internet but letting them avoid these harmful videos. There have been discussions ago about what videos children should or should not watch and how to prevent bad situations. In the early days when people were still using TV, different content would be broadcast at different periods to prevent children from watching some content. However, today’s Internet has given people more ways to acquire knowledge and mixed with a lot of uncomfortable content Content. The problem of children is mentioned here. In fact, on the other hand, the problems faced by adults are the same. There is a lot of nasty stuff like violence, blood, racism, fake news, etc., in it, and a lot of it is the work of bots, but people can’t tell the difference. Combined with the profit push, these videos are so endless that even filters can’t stop them. I agree with Bridle’s vision; we urgently need to solve and block and filter this video content. Otherwise, as time goes on, more people will see the profits brought by these videos stepping on morality and illegality and join the ranks of making these videos. The Internet also will go from a human gift to destruction.</p></br>
  <p>Modern children are exposed to the Internet at an early age, and much content is not suitable for their age to watch. But in today’s era of big data, the Internet has existed and infiltrated into our daily lives from all aspects, making it inevitable for children to come into contact with the Internet. Bridle took the video website Youtube as an example. Some cartoons or song videos suitable for children have attracted the attention of some advertisers and YouTubers because of their market, and they have produced a lot of pirated or magic-modified video content. The high playback volume of the bot pushed these videos that are not suitable for children to the front, the children clicked to watch it without knowing it, and the producers also benefited from the high playback volume. Bridle hopes to have a large-scale system to filter these videos of violence or child abuse and, by extension, a lot of fake news and other unrealistic content.</p>
