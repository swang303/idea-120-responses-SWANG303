<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

<p>I intend to mainly categorize my portfolio as painting, design, photography, video, and self-introduction. Five areas. The content of the work comes from my other courses and personal hobbies. The format is the work plus the introduction. The overall page should try to be simple; maybe try comic colors?</p>
