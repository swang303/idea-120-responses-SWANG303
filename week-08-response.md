  <h1>O'Neil Article Discussion</h1>
  <p>O'Neil described in the article that many profit-making organizations analyze people's personal information through network data to classify specific groups of people and push them into the trap of profit-making organizations through advertising push or other forms. The article focuses on some for-profit universities that use the information categories on their websites to push themselves to those poor students who need financial aid and then use loans and other forms to defraud the ignorant poor students of their money. These for-profit organizations capture those who are really in need, and the poor are even poorer, increasing the gap between rich and poor and rank. Spoofing student loans is very common and has been around much earlier, and the emergence of online classification patterns has amplified this situation. Data networks become accomplices, and profit organizations use them to weave a larger web.</p></br>
  <p>With the rapid development of the Internet era, people hope that these data networks can be more intelligent and bring users more convenient and efficient operations. And when big data can categorize people through their profiles and automatically push things of interest to everyone, these for-profits are taking advantage. Instead of getting help, many people who really need help go down the road of being deceived under the influence of these targeted ads. I can always see various advertisements using various websites or software these days. I have also become interested in advertisements such as "company recruiting interns" on the video website that young people prefer to use. I also thought about whether the website put this advertisement on the homepage because the advertisement content cooperates with the official and more authentic. However, when I searched for it online, many people replied that this advertisement was fraudulent. In fact, I still rely a lot on these methods when I use the Internet to search, but because there are too many false information mixed in, I have lost trust in most advertisements or content. If there is no these methods, I think it will increase the difficulty of people's use of data search, and today's false information cannot be greatly reduced.</P>
