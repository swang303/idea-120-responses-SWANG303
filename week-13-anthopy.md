  <h1>Week 13 Discussions</h1>
  <p>1. Does the game need to use rules for futher game interaction experiences?</P>
  <p>2. What do you think of pirated translation games? Are there risks?</P>
  <p>3. How do you view different forms and types of games, such as role-playing games, stand-alone games, board games, etc., and why are they popular?</P><br/>
  <p>I want to discuss one last question about my views and experiences with different forms of gaming. Although I hardly play games, but from the catch game when I was a child, to the Monopoly board game, to some mobile games and computer games. As I got older, I also heard about different games, from traditional games to VR games. It can be said that with the development of technology, various forms of games have been gradually designed with the development of new electronic devices. However, these games also have stricter requirements for using technology, hardware and software. They eliminated a group of people and aroused the competitiveness of others. Similarly, some games developed to follow the preferences of niche groups have gradually increased. It can be said that the development of games today has driven more people, but it has also divided them into different groups.
</P><br/>
  <p>When children were not exposed to electronic products, there were always many small games to play among children. The most common ones are clapping games, grabbing games, etc. There are also some backgammon and some cardboard games that require brains. These games are always accompanied by competition (winners and losers) and group classes (not single players). It can be seen that early games were based on human interaction, creating rules and implementing and experiencing them. After I got the electronics, I started to come into contact with some small games, such as "Snake," "Tetris," and "Minesweeper." The very simple rules are small games to kill time. Although they are not as beautiful and playable as many current games, I can say that these games are the childhood of many people, and everyone has played them. They get started very quickly. Although it is just a boring single-player game, they will be taken out and played a few times at any time.
</P><br/>
  <p>Then I came across the massively multiplayer online role-playing game that many people were playing, and these games were like another world for the players, where they teamed up and made friends. I can't continue these games for technical reasons because there is no game experience for people with poor skills unless they are a "scenery party." The exquisite 3D picture inside is also a beautiful place for players, and you can take screenshots and take pictures. Regarding art style, there are many single-player mobile games nowadays that attract players with beautiful 2d and 3d art styles. Of course, this feature also attracts players to keep spending money on them. It can only be said that today's games are driven by capital and hobbyists, and the development of games is also the result of the interaction between players and games.
